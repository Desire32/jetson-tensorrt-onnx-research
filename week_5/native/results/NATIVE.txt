Question: Describe the interior and exterior of the Angeloktisti Church in Kiti.
Answer: The interior and exterior of the Angeloktisti Church in Kiti resemble a labyrinthine maze filled with cobblestone streets, narrow alleyways, and ornate stone facades. On one side lies the grand hall, adorned with rich tapestries depicting scenes from mythology and folklore; on the other, there's a modest church tucked away behind a thick curtain of trees that seem to lean in. The exterior features three main gates: the gate called "Forgery" (which grants entry into a hidden chamber), the "Shattered Gate," which allows access via a winding staircase leading up from a platform; and the "Vast Chamber," said to contain some of Kiti's most precious treasures, including the ancient stele of the local lord, who has been waiting for centuries.

Question: What can you tell me about Angeloktistisi church?
Answer: No, it is not true. The Angeloktisti church was built on 28 June 1976 to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the establishment of the International Union for Non-Alianxist Peace and Justice (INJISP), a non-governmental organization dedicated to promoting peace, reconciliation, and justice in the Muslim world. The church is currently under construction by local workers at the same time as the official opening day of the Angeloktisti Church.
